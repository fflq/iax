/*
 * LORCON packet assembly system

 * Relatively naive system for assembling packets from a list of components
 * which are then frozen into a uint8_t array for injection.
 *
 * Packet components may be named.  No enforcement of name duplication
 * is made.
 *
 * Basic manipulation functions are provided for assembling packet
 * content.
