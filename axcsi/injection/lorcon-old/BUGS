wlan-ng and other drivers based on Prism2 chipsets (AirJack, Hostap) firmware
will reverse the supplied order of DA and SA addresses when the FromDS bit is
set.  Need to decide if this should be handled with a capabilities flag, or if
the injection code for these drivers should check for the presence of FromDS
and switch the address order automatically.

HostAP drivers are in Prism_AVS mode by default for monitor, need to change
to DLT_IEEE802_11 before packet injection

When dependencies are in directories with spaces in them (on Windows), libtool gets all confused, generating this error:

libtool: link: cannot find the library `' or unhandled argument `and'
make: *** [liborcon.la] Error 1

Solution: don't put dependencies in directory paths that include spaces.  I use C:\DEV, you should too.

Formerly, you could say tx80211_init, tx80211_setchannel, tx80211_open, 
tx80211_txpacket, tx80211_close.  With the changes to the madwifing handling
code however, we create a new VAP during tx80211_open which changes the
interface name. As such, it is mandatory to call tx80211_init followed by
tx80211_open BEFORE tx80211_setfuncmode or tx80211_setchannel.
